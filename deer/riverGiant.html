      On this episode of Midwest Whitetail, we follow along with Mike Reed as he
      closes the chapter on yet another River Farm legend. Going back all the
      way to 2020, this buck shined as a beautiful main frame 8 with true
      potential to blow into a monarch. Fast forward all these years later and
      Mike's plan to hunt the ghostly buck finally came to fruition. Join Mike
      as he dives into his step by step process for hunting "DK" during the 2023
      season dating back to finding the shed antler after a controlled burn in
      the spring. This one has it all from bucks chasing, buck vocalizations, 10
      yard shots, and another recovery that saw Mike take to the river! Let us
      know in the comments what questions you have and as always, thank you so
      much for taking the time to watch another episode of Midwest Whitetail.
