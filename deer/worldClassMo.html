      In this episode of Deer Season ‘23, we take you through the full story of
      Terry Drury’s biggest deer to date. When the trail camera pictures started
      rolling in this summer, Terry knew Mick Dundee was something special. Come
      fall, he frequented one little clover patch and a pond tucked into the
      timber, so they sat one blind over and over and over trying to get a crack
      at him. After six encounters, he finally put on the show of all shows.
      DeerCast said Good, he read the script, and offered up a 21-yard shot
      that's as pretty as it gets! I feel so blessed to have harvested such a
      special whitetail! We hope you enjoy this episode of Deer Season 23 and as
      always, we appreciate the continued support!
